Name: Take
Goal: Efficient software/GL "feature" engine with an emphasis for the features in software renderer, and 486 optimization hacks
Target platform: DOS, Win32, Linux
Base: QIP engine, CleanQuake

TODOS:
- = not done yet
* = in progress
/ = COM PLEETED

Version 1
/ no pop.lmp check
/ Old threatening quit messages
/ get -sndspeed working again (Sound frequency)
- Variable lightmap update delays (for relieving strains on 486s/early Pentiums)

Version 2
- Remove .ms2 meshing
- Move the "Quake" trademark name to an alterable string that can be changed on the fly so there is no hardcoded trademark brand names
- Menu background brown tint
- Implement different gun bobbing option (rip from Darkplaces)
* Double pixel size horizontal or vertical in 3d viewport
- Particle quality cvar (adjust amount of particles spawned)

Version 3
- Map lists (if maplist.txt is available, use that map list only for multiplayer map selection)
- Fix the wacky Win32 issue on newer machines that cause Win2k/XP to be oldschool looking and resizing all windows when in fullscreen (and that input delay issue on ATI cards as well)

Version 4
- Implement EF_ADDITIVE (with additive blending) in both GL and software
- Implement EF_FULLBRIGHT in both GL and software
- Interpolation option (rip from ToChriS)
- HL BSP loading (recoloring textures on load to the Quake palette on the fly in software)
- Skyboxes option (rip from ToChriS or Quake2)

Version 5
- Implement .alpha in both GL and software
- Implement .scale in both GL and software
- MD3 rendering (gl and software, optional low precision transform (for 486), rip from FTEQW)
- MD3 tags support (the toughest feature on this list)
- Downcolor any external 24/32bit textures to 8bit color on load (skyboxes, md3 skins)
- Implement modplug library for win32/linux platform (fake cdtracks as modules, rip from Darkplaces)
- Implement GL vertex BSP lighting (for single TMU cards, PowerVR PCX-2s and 486s, rip from mhQuake 5)
- Implement fog! IN SOFTWARE MODE TOO!!! (hey Laser Arena pulled it off somehow)
- Implement an all-new Half-Life-style (world space or view space scale) sprite coronas rendering extension, for software mode as well (and then get lordhavoc to adopt this into DP because I hate that generic glow corona)
- Get this to compile for Win16 somehow (that's right, Windows 3.1 support)
- ^ Do all this for the Quakeworld client too ^


Version 6
- Randomized pitch of sounds on playback
  - Rates to variate between are defined in .pit files (i.e. sound/weapons/sgun1.pit) like:
		sgun1.wav 15350 21000
	to randomize between 15350Hz and 21000Hz.
	(and also being able to redirect sounds for more pitch variations using the same sound)
- Optional, typical BUILD game style hud
- Implement MIDI playback support for Windows, DOS (Tie into Allegro? MIDIER?) and Linux
