The project file has been adapted from the QBism port http://qbism.telefragged.com/
For the case you have to change the assembler coding, I added some useful batch
files to recreate the libraries. Note that you currently need Microsoft's MASM
to compile the assembler code (see the QSML FAQ at http://www.quake-info-pool.net/ 
how to obtain it for free legally).

Before using the project file with WEdit32 you have to adapt them to your directory structure.
1. Replace D:\Coding\Quake with the directory you extracted the GAS2MASM source
2. Replace D:\Programme\Coding\lcc with the directory you installed LCC
