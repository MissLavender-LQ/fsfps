While developing a way to load external data from a VisPatch file into the Quake 
engine, I recognized that most VisPatch files contain data for several maps.
I enhanced the search process to look for a VisPatch file with the name of the 
map, and if not found then with the name of the directory the map was loaded 
from. This worked great for the original id (ID1.VIS) and mission pack maps 
(HIPNOTIC.VIS and ROGUE.VIS).

But still all VisPatch files for custom levels available at the WaterVis page 
(which is currently hosted on my homepage) were still not loaded.
So I had to write a small tool which splits those huge VisPatch files into 
separate files for each included map, and the VisPatch File Splitter is the result.

It's fairly easy to use. State the big VisPatch file which you want to split, 
and it will generate VisPatch files for each included map.
You can also call it with the "-?" parameter for a small help.
That's all about using it.

Now put the separate VisPatch files in your maps folder and you can play with 
transparent water without touching the original BSP file with the VisPatch tool. 
Also you do not need to mess around with all the PAK files of the different 
addons.

Enjoy
